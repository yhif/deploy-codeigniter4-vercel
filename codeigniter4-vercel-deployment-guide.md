# Deploy CodeIgniter 4 to Vercel: A Complete Guide

## The Challenge

Are you struggling to deploy your CodeIgniter 4 application to Vercel? You're not alone. Many developers face these common issues:

- ‚ùå Serverless environment configuration problems
- ‚ùå File system permission errors
- ‚ùå Cache directory access issues
- ‚ùå Database connection failures
- ‚ùå Static assets not loading correctly

## The Solution

This guide provides a step-by-step solution to deploy your CodeIgniter 4 application on Vercel's serverless platform. We'll address all the common pitfalls and provide working configurations.

## Why Vercel?

Vercel offers several advantages for CodeIgniter 4 applications:

- üöÄ Lightning-fast global CDN
- üîí Automatic SSL certificates
- üîÑ Zero-configuration deployments
- üìà Built-in analytics
- üí∞ Generous free tier

## Quick Start

1. **Project Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone your CodeIgniter 4 project
   git clone your-project
   cd your-project
   ```

2. **Create Vercel Configuration**
   Create `vercel.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "version": 2,
       "functions": {
         "api/*.php": {
           "runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.3"
         }
       },
       "routes": [
         {
           "src": "/(css|js|images)/(.*)", 
           "dest": "public/$1/$2"
         },
         {
           "src": "/(.*)",
           "dest": "/api/index.php"
         }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Create API Entry Point**
   ```bash
   mkdir api
   ```
   
   Create `api/index.php`:
   ```php
   <?php
   require __DIR__.'/../public/index.php';
   ```

4. **Fix Cache Issues**
   Modify `app/Config/Cache.php`:
   ```php
   public array $file = [
       'storePath' => '/tmp',
       'mode'      => 0640,
   ];
   ```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### 1. File System Permissions
Problem: Vercel's serverless environment is read-only.
Solution: Use `/tmp` directory for cache storage.

### 2. Database Connections
Problem: Database connection timeouts.
Solution: Use external database services with proper connection strings.

### 3. Static Assets
Problem: Assets not loading correctly.
Solution: Configure proper routes in `vercel.json`.

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store sensitive data in Vercel's environment variables
   - Never commit `.env` files to your repository

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable CodeIgniter 4 caching
   - Use Vercel's edge caching
   - Optimize database queries

3. **Security**
   - Use HTTPS (automatically provided by Vercel)
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Regular security updates

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Configure `vercel.json`
- [ ] Set up API entry point
- [ ] Configure cache storage
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Test database connections
- [ ] Verify static assets
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Monitor performance
